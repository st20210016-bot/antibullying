      <h2>Legal Consequences</h2>
      <p>
        In the UAE, bullying is not just a school issue – it can also be a legal matter.
        Cyberbullying, such as threats, defamation, or sharing private images without consent,
        is treated as a crime.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          Offences can lead to fines from <strong>AED 150,000 to AED 500,000</strong> and
          imprisonment of up to <strong>six months</strong>, depending on the case and how serious
          the harm is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Schools that ignore bullying can also face penalties. In serious situations, schools
        may receive large fines, face possible closure, and staff members can be held
        accountable if they fail to protect students or respond properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, parents have been held responsible for their children’s behaviour,
        with compensation ordered when their child’s actions harm others. This shows how
        strongly the UAE values safety, respect and responsibility.
