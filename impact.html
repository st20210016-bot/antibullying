        <h2>Emotional and Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
          Victims of bullying often feel sad, lonely, or afraid. Many lose confidence in
          themselves and start to believe the negative things being said about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, this can lead to anxiety, depression, or other mental health struggles.
          Some people may withdraw from friends, stop joining activities they enjoyed, or
          avoid school altogether.

      <h2>School, Friendships and the Future</h2>
      <p>
        Bullying affects more than just feelings. It can make it hard to concentrate in class,
        complete homework, or take part in group work. Some students see their grades drop
        because they are constantly stressed or distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bullying can also damage trust. Victims may find it difficult to make new friends or
        trust teachers and adults, even after the bullying stops. Without support, these
        experiences can continue to affect a person’s confidence and relationships well into adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bullies and bystanders are affected too. Bullies who are not challenged may continue using
        aggression in other relationships, while bystanders can feel guilty for not speaking up.
